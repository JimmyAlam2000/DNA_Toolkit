DNA Toolkit is an educational project designed to introduce basic bioinformatics operations in Python. With this repo, users and developers—especially those learning programming or computational biology—can:

Validate DNA sequences

Count nucleotide composition

Transcribe DNA → RNA

Generate reverse complements

Compute GC content

Future plans might include:

GUI-based visualization (e.g., nucleotide frequency graphs)

Translation of DNA to protein

Structural features like ORF detection

This toolkit serves as both a practical utility and a learning resource for anyone beginning in sequence analysis and Python programming.
